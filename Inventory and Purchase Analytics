# In this SQL query example, I am analyzing data from stock inventory and sales to provide insights for inventory management along with product performance.

# 1. How many units of each product are currently in stock?
SELECT product_name, SUM(inventory_units) AS total_stock
FROM Inventory
GROUP BY product_name;

# 2. Which products are running low on stock (less than 10 units)?
SELECT product_name
FROM Inventory
WHERE inventory_units < 10;

# 3. Calculating the total revenue and profit for each product category.
SELECT p.product_category, SUM(sales.price * sales.quantity) AS total_revenue,
       SUM((sales.price - cost.price) * sales.quantity) AS total_profit
FROM Sales sales
JOIN Products p ON sales.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN Costs cost ON p.product_id = cost.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_category;

# 4. Identifying the top-selling product in terms of revenue.
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(s.price * s.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;

# 5. Calculating the average order value for each month.
SELECT MONTH(order_date) AS order_month, AVG(order_total) AS avg_order_value
FROM Orders
GROUP BY order_month;

# 6. Which product categories have shown a consistent increase in sales over the last three months?
SELECT p.product_category
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.order_date >= DATEADD(MONTH, -3, GETDATE())
GROUP BY p.product_category
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT s.order_id) > 1;

# How this can answer or aid stakeholder inquiries: 

I utilized SQL queries that are aimed to aid inventory management and understand the overall product performance. The first two queries in SQL
provide insights into the current stock levels and products that require immediate attention for replenishment. This information is crucial for ensuring products are available to meet consumer demands. 

Next, I calculated the total revenue and profit for each product category, enabling the identification of which product categories are most financially successful and where adjustments may be needed.
The top-selling products in terms of revenue where identified, allowing focus on products that moved the north-star metric, this insight aids marketing strategies. 
Next, the average order value per month was identified, this gives a clearer understanding of customer spending patterns over time, which can inform pricing strategies.
Finally, I identified product categories that were consistently performing well over the last three months, which allows for the allocation of resources and marketing efforts to be sustainable. 

Through analyzing the inventory and sales data, informed decisions about inventory restocking, pricing strategies, and product promotion, 
can ultimately optimize ops and revenue generation. Furthermore, I made visualizations generating insights to guide the decision-making process.
