# In this SQL I am querying a Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction dataset from the CDC to analyze variables that 
relate to lifestyle factors of an individual or patient that can be attributed to being at low, or high-risk with cardiovascular diseases.

# 1. Calculating the average BMI for each age category.
SELECT Age_Category, AVG(BMI) AS avg_bmi
FROM Cardio_Data
GROUP BY Age_Category;

# 2. Identifying the proportion of individuals with heart disease for each exercise status.
SELECT Exercise, COUNT(CASE WHEN Heart_Disease = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) AS num_with_heart_disease,
       COUNT(*) AS total_individuals,
       (COUNT(CASE WHEN Heart_Disease = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS heart_disease_percentage
FROM Cardio_Data
GROUP BY Exercise;

# 3. Calculating the average height and weight for males and females.
SELECT Sex, AVG(Height_(cm)) AS avg_height, AVG(Weight_(kg)) AS avg_weight
FROM Cardio_Data
GROUP BY Sex;

# 4. Identifying the most common smoking history among individuals with diabetes.
SELECT Smoking_History, COUNT(*) AS num_individuals
FROM Cardio_Data
WHERE Diabetes = 'Yes'
GROUP BY Smoking_History
ORDER BY num_individuals DESC
LIMIT 1;

# 5. Identifying the age category with the highest consumption of green vegetables.
SELECT Age_Category, SUM(Green_Vegetables_Consumption) AS total_green_vegetables_consumption
FROM Cardio_Data
GROUP BY Age_Category
ORDER BY total_green_vegetables_consumption DESC
LIMIT 2;

# 6. Identifying the age category with the highest consumption of green vegetables and fruits.
SELECT Age_Category, SUM(Green_Vegetables_Consumption) AS total_green_vegetables_consumption,
       SUM(Fruit_Consumption) AS total_fruit_consumption
FROM Cardio_Data
GROUP BY Age_Category
ORDER BY total_green_vegetables_consumption DESC
LIMIT 2;

# 7. Comparing the average fruit and vegetable consumption to weight.
SELECT Age_Category, AVG(Fruit_Consumption) AS avg_fruit_consumption,
       AVG(Green_Vegetables_Consumption) AS avg_vegetables_consumption,
       AVG(Weight_(kg)) AS avg_weight
FROM Cardio_Data
GROUP BY Age_Category;

# Identifying the proportion of individuals with heart disease for each exercise status, helps us to understand how exercise impacts risk. Additionally, identifying common smoking history among individuals with diabetes, highlights potential connections between smoking and diabetes.
# Identifying the age category with the highest consumption of green vegetables and fruits, aids in understanding age-related dietary habits.
# These SQL queries provide valuable insights into health trends, and risk factors. These insights can be used to inform strategies for patients of health firms, interventions, and for public health initiatives.
