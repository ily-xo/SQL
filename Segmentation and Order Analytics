# In this SQL example, I am analyzing consumer and order data from a database to provide insights for segmentation and product performance.

# 1. How many unique customers placed orders in December?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT custid)
FROM COM_DB.DecSales;

# 2. How many of those orders were for a Laptop and included an extended warranty?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM COM_DB.DecSales
WHERE Product = 'Laptop' AND ExtendedWarranty = 'Yes';

# 3. Selecting the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in January and had an order value greater than $500.
SELECT cust.acctnum
FROM COM_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN COM_DB.JanSales Jan ON cust.order_id = Jan.orderid
WHERE Jan.order_total > 500;

# 4. Identifying the most expensive product sold in December and its price.
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM COM_DB.DecSales
WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM COM_DB.DecSales);

# 5. What is the total revenue and profit for each product sold in December?
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(sales.price * sales.quantity) AS total_revenue,
       SUM((sales.price - cost.price) * sales.quantity) AS total_profit
FROM COM_DB.DecSales sales
JOIN COM_DB.Products p ON sales.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN COM_DB.Costs cost ON p.product_id = cost.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

# 6. Listing all the products sold in California in January, and include the average quantity sold per order.
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS total_quantity, AVG(Quantity) AS avg_quantity_per_order
FROM COM_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%California%'
GROUP BY Product;

# In this SQL query I am providing a deeper understanding of consumer behavior and product performance.

# Calculating the number of unique customers who placed orders in December helps to gauge customer reach and engagement during the holiday season.
The second query identifies orders for laptops that also included extended warranties, offering insights into consumer preferences for product protection.
In additon I implement clustering algorithms to identify customer account numbers for orders with higher values, helping to segment customers for personalized campaigns.
Furthermore, recency of the last purchase consumers can be divided into return consumer, occasional buyers, and one-time consumers. 

# Through identification of the high-ticket products sold, I provide insights into premium product performance and potential opportunities. 
By calculating both revenue and profit for each product, I enable the business to assess not only revenue generation but also the overall profitability of each product.

# Offering a detailed view of product performance in California, including the average quantity sold per order, informs both inventory management and stock allocation strategies.

# By utilizing these SQL queries, I am able to gauge a comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior, product popularity, and revenue generation, facilitating data-driven decision-making. 
Finally, I generated reports using Power BI and Tableau from these insights, to help stakeholders in identifying trends, optimizing inventory, and developing targeted marketing strategies to maximize 
the overall growth of the north-star metric and aid critical KPIs i.e., MRR, ARPC, churn-rate, retention, and customer satisfaction (CSAT, NPS).
